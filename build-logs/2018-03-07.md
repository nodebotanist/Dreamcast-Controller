Started work on this. Did some research regarding A) making it an HID device and B) making it a bluetooth HID device.

For non-bluetooth, teensy is the way to go: 

* [raw HID](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/rawhid.html)
* [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_keyboard.html)

Nov for bluetooth, things get weird. The closest thing I've found so far is flashing

On stream I took the controller apart and started soldering! I learned a lot about the traces and how the buttons and switches work

THe down button is acting funky now. But the left button works!
